## Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

A simple Python program that implements the Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption.

## Description

This repository contains a Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

## Features

```
    Encrypt text using a fixed shift of 3.
    Decrypt encrypted text using the reverse shift of 3.
```

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
```
    Python 3.x
```

## Usage

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd caesar-cipher
```

Run the script:
```
python caesar_cipher.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to either encrypt or decrypt text.

## Example

To encrypt text:
```
Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? (e/d): e
Enter the text to encrypt: Hello, World!
Encrypted text: Khoor, Zruog!
```

To decrypt text:
```
Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? (e/d): d
Enter the text to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypted text: Hello, World!
```
